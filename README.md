chatbot spells a word entered by user(Text-to-Audio)

## Ojective of my chatbot :

  - Name of my ChatBot is  _**JACOB.**_
  
  - It is designed to spell the word enter by user.
  
  - We dont know how to spell some words properly so in that case my chatbot helps you to pronounce correctly.
  
  - It also greets the user.
  
## Working of my Bot :

  - Firstly webpage contains a Title Spell Bot and a Welcome note and a START button and NEXT button in which a small note that shows to click the start button.
  
  - Next button is in disable mode.
  
  - When the user clicks the START button then the bot introduces itself as JACOB and asks the user name and to click next button.
  
  - After clicking START button the next button is enabled and on clicking the next button the page will redirect to another page which takes the name of user as input.
  
  - Now 2 notes is available for user understanding and after entering user name the chatbot greets the user and asks the user to enter the word the user want to know how to spell.
  
  - The user can know how to spell as many as words he can by using this bot and by clicking end button the bot finally salutate the user.
